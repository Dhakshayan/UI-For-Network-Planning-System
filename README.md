# Network Planning System (NPS) - UI Design

This project demonstrates a user interface(UI) for network planning, including key features such as a dark and light mode toggle switch, dynamic data tables, and interactive line charts. 
# Please note that this is a UI design only and not a fully functional application.

## Features

### Dark and Light Mode Toggle
- **Dark Mode**: Uses a combination of grey and blue colours for a comfortable viewing experience in low-light environments.
- **Light Mode**: Utilizes white and teal colours for a bright interface suitable for well-lit conditions.
- The mode can be toggled using the "Light/Dark Mode" button in the navigation bar.

### Dynamic Line Charts
- The line chart displays important data points such as quantities and SKU counts over specified dates.
- The colours of the chart lines adapt to the selected theme (dark or light mode) for consistent visual integration.
- The chart is rendered using the Chart.js library, ensuring responsiveness and ease of customization.

### Dynamic Data Tables
- The data tables provide a structured format for displaying network plans, including source and destination locations, dates, quantities, and SKU counts.
- Data values are generated dynamically using JavaScript, changing with each page refresh to simulate real-time updates.

## Importance of Design
Design plays a crucial role in user experience and functionality.
- **Consistency**: Colour schemes and layouts ensure a cohesive look and feel.
- **Responsiveness**: Flexible layouts and responsive components.
- **Interactivity**: Interactive elements like the toggle switch and dynamic charts.
